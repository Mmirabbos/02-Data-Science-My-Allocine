# My Allocine

## Task
The task is to make the correct queries for the movie database in sql and ruby.

## Description

This code accepts requests from users and flirts its database, which is in `sql(.db)` format and produces the necessary films or genres at the request of the user

[Movies.db](https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-claris/movies.db)

## Installation

You can only install the database in `sql(.db)` format because I don't use library libraries

## Library Info

I don't use libraries here. I only use `Ruby` and `SQLlite`

## Usage

My code simply requests a request for data, for example, we have a movie site where the user requests a certain genre of films and my code, more precisely, my request filters the database in sql format
